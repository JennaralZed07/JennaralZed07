Hi! I'm JennaralZed. I am currently in the Google Data Analytics Certification program. I am also working on IT Support certification. 
For now, I am learning the foundational pieces. I'm a little lost in the world of coding for data careers, specifically an analyst. 
I am certain that I'll develop the skills and grow into having a nice profile of work here.
